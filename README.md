## Deep Hedging

Deep Hedging was proposed in [[1802.03042]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03042)  by Hans BÃ¼hler, Lukas Gonon, Josef Teichmann and Ben Wood.

The idea is to use a neural network architecture to hedge a portfolio of derivatives without computing the "greeks".

This notebook is based on the lectures given by Josef Teichmann.
